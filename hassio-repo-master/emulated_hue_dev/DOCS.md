# Emulated Hue for Home Assistant

This is the development version of the addon that
will allow you to more easily debug and modify Emulated Hue.

On startup, this addon will download the latest changes from
Github, install the code, and run it. You can also specify
your own fork so you can make changes and test them yourself!

## Configuration Options

### Option: `http_port`

Enter an integer to specify a custom http port. This defaults to port 80 if not specified. 

### Option: `https_port`

Enter an integer to specify a custom https port. This defaults to port 443 if not specified.

### Option: `tag_commit_or_branch`

Enter any tag, commit hash, or branch name that you want to
pull from.

By default, this will download from the main repository, but you can
specify your own repository by using this syntax:

`username:tag_commit_or_branch`

or

`username:repository_name:tag_commit_or_branch`

If the repository name is not specified, the addon will default to
a repository named "core" for the specified username.

Below, you can find some more information on how to obtain a tag/commit hash/branch
